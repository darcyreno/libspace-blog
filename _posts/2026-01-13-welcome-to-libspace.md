Welcome to LibSpace! We're excited to have you here. LibSpace makes it easy to send articles, documents, and books to your e-reader instantly.

## Getting Started

Here's how to get the most out of LibSpace:

### 1. Connect Your E-Reader

Head to [Settings](https://libspace.io/settings) to connect your Boox or Kindle device. For Boox devices, you'll need to sign in with your Onyx account credentials. For Kindle, we'll send files directly to your Send-to-Kindle email.

### 2. Save Articles with the Browser Extension

Install our browser extension for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore) or [Safari](https://apps.apple.com) to save articles with one click. When you find an article you want to read later, just click the LibSpace icon.

### 3. Subscribe to RSS Feeds

Love a particular blog or newsletter? Subscribe to their RSS feed in LibSpace and we'll automatically save new articles to your library. You can even enable auto-sync to send them directly to your e-reader.

### 4. Upload Your Own Files

Have PDFs, EPUBs, or other documents? Upload them directly to LibSpace and sync them to your device. We support PDF, EPUB, MOBI, TXT, HTML, Markdown, and more.

## Tips for Better Reading

- **Use the mobile app** for reading on your phone when you don't have your e-reader handy
- **Organize with tags** to keep your library tidy
- **Mark articles as read** to track what you've finished
- **Archive instead of delete** to keep articles you might want to reference later
